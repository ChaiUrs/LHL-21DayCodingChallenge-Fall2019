Welcome to Codeville, and the 21-Day Coding Challenge! Technology has reached Codeville, and as the mayor of this small hamlet, you have the task of finding ways to use technology to improve your town. Over the next 21 days, you’ll use technology to streamline your re-election campaign, implement smart city technology to bring Codeville into the future, and plan a town celebration for the community. Each step along the way, you’ll use code to help you.

## Overview
